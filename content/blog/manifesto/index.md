[Web3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/) is a controversial topic. This is mostly due to misinformation stemming from a general misunderstanding. By taking the time to understand the[ long-term vision and the technology](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) that makes this all possible, you will find a fascinating new world - an evolution of the internet that was conceptualized by taking existing technologies and combining them in clever ways.

So how can we remove the toxicity so people can instead focus on what's important: building open decentralised applications.

The solution: The Writers Chain. The aim of The Writers Chain is to build a decentralized writing platform using Web3 technologies with a feature set similar to centralized platforms like Medium. Anyone will be able to launch their website in minutes, which includes subscriptions for paid content, accepting payments as donations, being able to sell their work as NFTs, and building a community. All without going through an intermediary. And[ Solana](https://solana.com/) provides us with the most important tooling.

If all of this sounds overwhelming, don't despair. We are here to break down the fence so everyone has access to the garden. But before we embark on that journey, it is just as important to understand why it was put up in the first place. This will all be explained in detail through a set of step-by-step articles as we build out each of the features for people with minimal technical knowledge, and the code will always remain [open and maintained by the community](https://github.com/TYRONEMICHAEL/the-writers-chain). So if you want to learn more about Web3, or you want a reference on how to build a decentralized application, or if you are just looking for a place to write together with a like-minded community, The Writers Chain will be your one-stop-shop.

We believe having a good grasp of Web3 fundamentals and a working, thriving example will help dispel misinformation and inspire innovation in this space. We always encourage healthy discussions and if there is anything you strongly disagree with,[ please voice your opinion](https://twitter.com/tyroneavnit). We just politely ask;[ Give it 5 minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) before doing so. 

This is my gift to the curious, the builders, and the problem-solvers.
